Lower retention arm gently\n\n#### Memory (RAM) Installation\n1. **Open memory slot clips**\n2. **Check motherboard manual** for proper slot configuration\n   - 2 sticks: Usually slots A2 and B2 (2nd and 4th from CPU)\n   - 4 sticks: All slots (A1, A2, B1, B2)\n3. **Align RAM notch** with slot notch\n4. **Press down firmly** until clips snap into place\n5. **Verify even seating** - both ends should be level\n\n#### M.2 NVMe Drive Installation\n1. **Locate M.2 slots** on motherboard\n2. **Remove mounting screw** (usually pre-installed)\n3. **Insert drive at 30-degree angle**\n4. **Press down and secure** with screw\n5. **Use thermal pads** if provided with motherboard\n\n### Step 3: CPU Cooler Installation\n\n#### Thermal Paste Application\n\n**For 2-Screw Cooler Brackets (AIO/Large Air Coolers)**:\n- **Method**: Spreading technique\n- **Amount**: Rice grain sized amount\n- **Application**:\n  1. Place small amount in center of CPU\n  2. Use plastic card or included spreader\n  3. Spread evenly in thin layer across entire CPU surface\n  4. Avoid air bubbles\n  5. Layer should be translucent\n\n**For 4-Screw Cooler Brackets (Standard Air Coolers)**:\n- **Method**: Dot technique\n- **Amount**: Pea-sized dot\n- **Application**:\n  1. Place single dot in center of CPU\n  2. Do NOT spread manually\n  3. Let cooler mounting pressure spread paste\n  4. This method reduces air bubble formation\n\n#### Air Cooler Installation\n1. **Install mounting brackets** per manual instructions\n2. **Apply thermal paste** using appropriate method above\n3. **Mount cooler** with even pressure on all mounting points\n4. **Tighten screws** in X-pattern (diagonal opposite corners)\n5. **Connect cooler fan** to CPU_FAN header\n\n#### AIO Liquid Cooler Installation\n1. **Apply thermal paste** using spreading method\n2. **Mount pump/block** to CPU with even pressure\n3. **Install radiator** in case (front or top recommended)\n4. **Connect pump** to CPU_FAN or AIO_PUMP header\n5. **Connect radiator fans** to CHA_FAN headers\n\n### Step 4: Motherboard Installation in Case\n\n1. **Carefully place motherboard** on standoffs\n2. **Align with I/O shield ports**\n3. **Install screws** in all standoff positions\n4. **Don't over-tighten** - snug is sufficient\n\n### Step 5: Power Supply Installation\n\n1. **Orient PSU correctly** (fan direction)\n2. **Slide into position** from inside case\n3. **Secure with 4 screws** from outside rear of case\n4. **Leave PSU power switch OFF** until build complete\n\n### Step 6: Storage Drive Installation\n\n#### SATA Drives (2.5\" SSD / 3.5\" HDD)\n1. **Mount drives** in appropriate bays\n2. **Secure with screws** (usually 4 per drive)\n3. **Connect SATA power** from PSU\n4. **Connect SATA data** to motherboard\n\n#### Additional M.2 Drives\n1. **Install in remaining M.2 slots**\n2. **Check motherboard manual** for SATA/PCIe lane conflicts\n3. **Use heatsinks** if motherboard doesn't provide them\n\n### Step 7: Graphics Card Installation\n\n1. **Remove PCIe slot covers** from case (usually 2 slots)\n2. **Open PCIe x16 retention clip**\n3. **Align card with top PCIe x16 slot**\n4. **Press down firmly** until clip engages\n5. **Secure with screws** to case bracket\n6. **Connect PCIe power cables** (if required)\n\n### Step 8: Power Connections\n\n#### Essential Power Connections\n1. **24-pin ATX** to motherboard\n2. **8-pin CPU power** (top-left of motherboard)\n3. **PCIe power** to graphics card (if required)\n4. **SATA power** to drives\n5. **Molex/peripheral** connections as needed\n\n#### Modular PSU Cable Management\n- **Use only required cables**\n- **Route behind motherboard tray**\n- **Leave some slack** for component access\n- **Secure with zip ties**\n\n### Step 9: Front Panel Connections\n\n#### Required Connections\n- **Power button** (PWR SW)\n- **Reset button** (RST SW) \n- **Power LED** (PWR LED)\n- **HDD LED** (HDD LED)\n- **USB headers** (USB 2.0 and 3.0/3.1)\n- **Audio headers** (HD AUDIO)\n\n**Tip**: Consult motherboard manual for exact pin layout\n\n## Airflow Configuration\n\n### Understanding Air Movement\n\n#### Push vs Pull Fan Configurations\n\n**Push Configuration**:\n- **Fan blows air THROUGH** radiator/heatsink\n- **More effective** for dust filtration\n- **Better for high-restriction** components\n- **Easier maintenance** (clean fan side)\n\n**Pull Configuration**:\n- **Fan draws air THROUGH** radiator/heatsink\n- **Slightly better cooling** in some scenarios\n- **More difficult** to clean (dust on heatsink side)\n- **Can create negative pressure**\n\n### Case Fan Placement & Direction\n\n#### Front Case Fans (Intake)\n**Configuration**: 2-3 fans, 120mm or 140mm\n- **Direction**: Push (blowing INTO case)\n- **Purpose**: Bring cool air into case\n- **Mounting**: Fans on outside of case, pushing through dust filter\n- **Benefits**: Creates positive pressure, reduces dust\n\n#### Rear Case Fan (Exhaust)\n**Configuration**: 1 fan, typically 120mm\n- **Direction**: Pull (drawing air OUT of case)\n- **Purpose**: Exhaust hot air from CPU area\n- **Mounting**: Fan inside case, pulling air through rear vent\n- **Location**: Behind CPU cooler area\n\n#### Top Case Fans (Exhaust)\n**Configuration**: 1-2 fans, 120mm or 140mm\n- **Direction**: Pull (drawing air OUT of case)\n- **Purpose**: Exhaust hot air rising from components\n- **Mounting**: Fans inside case, pulling air up and out\n- **Considerations**: \n  - May interfere with tall CPU coolers\n  - Creates negative pressure if too many exhaust fans\n\n### Optimal Airflow Patterns\n\n### Case Pressure Systems\n\n#### Understanding Case Pressure\nCase pressure affects cooling efficiency, dust accumulation, and system noise. The relationship between intake and exhaust fans determines whether your case operates under positive, negative, or neutral pressure.\n\n#### Positive Pressure Setup\n**Configuration**: More intake CFM than exhaust CFM\n- **Setup Examples**:\n  - 3 intake front (120mm @ 1200 RPM) + 1 exhaust rear (120mm @ 1000 RPM)\n  - 2 intake front (140mm @ 1000 RPM) + 1 exhaust rear (120mm @ 1000 RPM)\n- **Benefits**:\n  - **Reduced dust infiltration** - air enters through filtered intakes only\n  - **Consistent airflow** - predictable air entry points\n  - **Less maintenance** - dust stays on filters instead of components\n- **Drawbacks**:\n  - **Slightly higher temperatures** - some hot air recirculation\n  - **More noise** - intake fans work harder\n- **Best for**: Dusty environments, low-maintenance systems\n\n#### Negative Pressure Setup\n**Configuration**: More exhaust CFM than intake CFM\n- **Setup Examples**:\n  - 2 intake front (120mm @ 1000 RPM) + 1 exhaust rear + 2 exhaust top (120mm @ 1200 RPM each)\n  - 2 intake front (120mm @ 1000 RPM) + 1 exhaust rear + 1 exhaust top (140mm @ 1200 RPM)\n- **Benefits**:\n  - **Better cooling performance** - efficient hot air removal\n  - **Lower component temperatures** - no hot air recirculation\n  - **GPU cooling boost** - helps exhaust GPU heat faster\n- **Drawbacks**:\n  - **Increased dust infiltration** - air pulled through unfiltered gaps\n  - **More cleaning required** - dust settles on components\n  - **Unpredictable airflow** - air enters from multiple uncontrolled points\n- **Best for**: High-performance systems, clean environments, maximum cooling priority\n\n#### Neutral Pressure Setup\n**Configuration**: Equal intake and exhaust CFM\n- **Setup Examples**:\n  - 2 intake front (120mm @ 1200 RPM) + 1 exhaust rear + 1 exhaust top (120mm @ 1200 RPM each)\n  - 3 intake front (120mm @ 1000 RPM) + 2 exhaust rear + top (140mm @ 1000 RPM)\n- **Benefits**:\n  - **Balanced cooling and dust control**\n  - **Moderate maintenance requirements**\n  - **Good all-around performance**\n- **Drawbacks**:\n  - **Harder to achieve** - requires careful fan selection and speed matching\n  - **Can shift between positive/negative** with fan speed changes\n- **Best for**: Most gaming builds, balanced approach\n\n### Optimal Airflow Patterns by Use Case\n\n#### Standard Gaming Build\n**Setup**: 2 intake front (140mm) + 1 exhaust rear (120mm)\n- **Pressure**: Positive\n- **Benefits**: Good temperatures, reduced dust, quiet operation\n- **Fan Speeds**: Intake 800-1000 RPM, Exhaust 1000-1200 RPM\n\n#### High-Performance Gaming\n**Setup**: 3 intake front (120mm) + 1 exhaust rear + 1 exhaust top (120mm)\n- **Pressure**: Slightly negative\n- **Benefits**: Maximum cooling potential for CPU and GPU\n- **Fan Speeds**: Intake 1000-1200 RPM, Exhaust 1200-1400 RPM\n\n#### Quiet Office Build\n**Setup**: 2 intake front (140mm) + 1 exhaust rear (120mm)\n- **Pressure**: Positive\n- **Benefits**: Very quiet operation, adequate cooling\n- **Fan Speeds**: All fans 600-800 RPM max\n\n#### Overclocking/Enthusiast\n**Setup**: 3 intake front + 1 intake bottom + 1 exhaust rear + 2 exhaust top\n- **Pressure**: Balanced to slightly negative\n- **Benefits**: Maximum heat removal for extreme cooling\n- **Fan Speeds**: Intake 1000-1400 RPM, Exhaust 1200-1600 RPM\n\n### Fan Speed Control\n\n#### BIOS Fan Curves\n1. **CPU fans**: Aggressive curve (high speeds at high temps)\n2. **Case fans**: Gentle curve (consistent low-medium speeds)\n3. **GPU fans**: Usually controlled by graphics card\n\n#### PWM vs DC Fans\n- **PWM (4-pin)**: Better speed control, quieter at low speeds\n- **DC (3-pin)**: Voltage controlled, simpler but less precise\n\n### Airflow Troubleshooting\n\n#### Hot Spots\n- **CPU area**: Add rear exhaust if missing\n- **GPU area**: Consider bottom intake or side exhaust\n- **VRM area**: Top exhaust helps remove heat from motherboard\n\n#### Dust Management\n- **Positive pressure** reduces dust infiltration\n- **Clean intake filters** monthly\n- **Mount intake fans** on outside of case when possible\n\n## Cable Management\n\n### Planning Cable Routes\n1. **24-pin ATX**: Route behind motherboard tray\n2. **CPU power**: Route behind and up through top opening\n3. **PCIe power**: Route behind and through side opening\n4. **SATA cables**: Keep short and route behind tray\n5. **Front panel**: Bundle and route to avoid fan interference\n\n### Cable Management Tips\n- **Leave some slack** for future maintenance\n- **Use zip ties** every 4-6 inches\n- **Avoid tight bends** in cables\n- **Keep airflow paths clear**\n- **Route similar cables together**\n\n## Final Assembly Steps\n\n### Pre-Boot Checklist\n1. **Verify all power connections**\n2. **Check RAM is fully seated**\n3. **Confirm CPU cooler is connected**\n4. **Ensure GPU is properly secured**\n5. **Connect monitor to GPU** (not motherboard)\n6. **Switch PSU power ON**\n\n### First Boot\n1. **Press power button**\n2. **Look for POST screen** or motherboard logo\n3. **Enter BIOS** (usually DEL or F2 key)\n4. **Verify all components detected**\n5. **Check temperatures** (should be reasonable at idle)\n6. **Enable XMP/DOCP** for RAM\n7. **Set fan curves** if needed\n\n### Post-Build Testing\n1. **Install operating system**\n2. **Update all drivers**\n3. **Run stress tests**:\n   -

    "body": "# CPU vs GPU: Understanding the Differences\n\n## What is a CPU?\n\nA **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is often called the \"brain\" of your computer. It's a highly versatile processor designed to handle a wide variety of tasks sequentially with incredible speed and precision.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n- Few cores (typically 4-16 for consumer models, up to 64+ for high-end)\n- High clock speeds (3.5-5.8 GHz)\n- Excellent at single-threaded performance\n- Handles operating system, background processes, and general computing\n\n**Best Used For:**\n- Running your operating system and applications\n- Web browsing and productivity software\n- Gaming (handles game logic, AI, physics)\n- Programming and compilation\n- Database operations\n- General multitasking\n\n**Example Products:**\n- AstraLogic Blade 4600 (entry-level gaming)\n- ZentriCore Apex 8600X (mid-range performance)\n- NovaChip Titan 14900K (high-end workstation)\n\n---\n\n## What is a GPU?\n\nA **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** is a specialized processor designed to handle thousands of simple calculations simultaneously. Originally built for rendering graphics, modern GPUs excel at any task requiring massive parallel processing.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n- Thousands of smaller cores (2,000-16,000+)\n- Lower individual core speeds\n- Exceptional at parallel processing\n- Dedicated video memory (VRAM)\n\n**Best Used For:**\n- Gaming graphics rendering\n- 3D modeling and rendering\n- Video editing and encoding\n- Machine learning and AI\n- Cryptocurrency mining\n- Scientific simulations\n- Image/video processing\n\n**Example Products:**\n- PyraTech GraphForce 4070 16GB (1080p gaming)\n- Orionix Radiant RX 7800 XT (1440p/4K gaming)\n- VortexLabs Horizon RX820L (professional workstation)\n\n---\n\n## Key Differences\n\n| Feature | CPU | GPU |\n|---------|-----|-----|\n| **Core Count** | 4-64 cores | 2,000-16,000+ cores |\n| **Processing Style** | Sequential, complex tasks | Parallel, simple tasks |\n| **Clock Speed** | Higher (3-5+ GHz) | Lower (1-2.5 GHz) |\n| **Best At** | Varied, complex calculations | Repetitive, similar calculations |\n| **Price Range** | $100-$2,000+ | $150-$2,500+ |\n\n---\n\n## Practical Examples\n\n**Gaming:**\n- **CPU handles:** Game logic, enemy AI, physics calculations, managing game state\n- **GPU handles:** Rendering frames, lighting effects, textures, shadows, post-processing\n- Both are essential! A weak CPU bottlenecks your GPU and vice versa.\n\n**Video Editing:**\n- **CPU handles:** Timeline scrubbing, applying effects, managing the application\n- **GPU handles:** Real-time preview rendering, effects acceleration, final encoding (if supported)\n\n**3D Rendering:**\n- **CPU rendering:** More accurate, handles complex lighting (raytracing historically)\n- **GPU rendering:** Much faster for preview and certain render engines, requires adequate VRAM\n\n**Office Work:**\n- **CPU handles:** Nearly everything (documents, spreadsheets, email, web browsing)\n- **GPU handles:** Minimal work; integrated graphics often sufficient\n\n---\n\n## Do You Need Both?\n\n**Yes, for most systems!** Your computer needs a CPU to function. The GPU question depends on your use case:\n\n**Integrated Graphics (CPU with built-in GPU):**\n- Sufficient for: Office work, web browsing, light photo editing, casual older games\n\n**Dedicated Graphics Card:**\n- Required for: Modern gaming, 3D work, video editing, machine learning\n- Provides: Significantly better performance and dedicated VRAM\n\n---\n\n## Making Your Decision\n\n**For Gaming Builds:**\n- Balance is key! Match your CPU and GPU to avoid bottlenecks\n- 1080p gaming: Mid-range CPU + mid-range GPU\n- 1440p/4K gaming: High-end GPU becomes more important\n\n**For Workstations:**\n- Content creation: Prioritize cores (CPU) and VRAM (GPU)\n- Programming: Strong CPU, basic GPU often sufficient\n- 3D/Video work: High-end both CPU and GPU\n\n**For General Use:**\n- Modern CPU with integrated graphics handles most tasks\n- Save money on GPU unless you have specific needs\n\n---\n\n## Need Help Choosing?\n\nOur support team can help you select the right CPU and GPU combination for your specific needs and budget. Just open a support ticket or use our Custom PC Configurator tool for compatibility-checked recommendations.\n)",

    "body": "**Standard Operating Procedure: Vendor Shipment Intake**\n\n**Purpose:** This document outlines the process for receiving, inspecting, and cataloging incoming vendor shipments at the CoreCraft Louisville warehouse facility. Note: for this procedure, you will need a company tablet, access to the intake/inventory software, and your employee badge. \n\n**Step 1: Initial Receipt**\nWhen a vendor shipment arrives, the receiving employee should follow this procedure: \\n\n1. Log into the inventory software (ITS). \\n\n2. Scan your badge to access the intake area of inventory. \\n\n3. Begin a new delivery intake by clicking on 'Receive a Shipment' in ITS.  \\n\n4. Enter a new shipment number, using this format: YYYYDDMM_VENDOR_SHIPPINGCOMPANY_001. \\n\n5. Visually inspect each package for damage. If there is **NO VISIBLE DAMAGE**, sign off on the package. If there is **VISIBLE DAMAGE** to the package, see the section on **'Damaged Shipments'** below.  \\n\n6. Click the 'Photos' button and use the tablet to take a picture of each package. This will attach the photos to this shipment. \\n\n7. Scan the barcode on each package, if available outside. Make sure the code shows up properly in the system. \\n\n8. Place each package into the 'RECEIVING' pallet box or into a 'RECEIVING' bin, taking care not to stack the pallet higher than one box or one bin.\n\n**Step 2: Unpacking and Visual Inspection of Components**\nAll Components must be unpacked and entered into inventory. \\n\n1. Open up ITS, scanning your badge to access the system. \\n\n2. Open the previous shipment you created and select 'QA Check' on the shipment tab. \\n\n3. Remove the shipment manifest and inspect the components to ensure they visually match. \\n\n4. Enter the order number and vendor account into the system. \\n\n5. Print out a list of order stickers to label the items. \\n\n6. Select 'Add Components', then scan the SKU on each component, ensuring it scans properly into ITS. \\n\n7. Photograph each component in the box and again as you unpack each component onto a clean, empty table. \\n\n8. Put an order number sticker on each component. \\n\n9. If you see any **VISUALLY DAMAGED** items, put a red 'Damaged' sticker on them and put them in the 'DAMAGED SHIPMENTS' bin, then see the section on **'Damaged Shipments'** below. \\n\n10. Non-visibly damaged items should be labeled with a yellow 'QA Check' sticker and be placed in a 'QA CHECK' bin. \\n\n11. In the ITS system, finalize the shipment reception by clicking on 'Received' in the Shipment tab. \n\n**Step 3: Quality Assurance of Components**\nAll Components that pass visual inspection must be checked for quality: \\n\n1. Remove each component from the 'QA CHECK' bin and place them on your workbench. \\n\n2. Scan the SKU code and order number to open the order in ITS. Check each component as per CoreCraft protocols (see knowledgebase article). \\n\n3. If a component passes QA,  mark it as 'Passed' in the system. Remove the yellow 'QA Check' label from the component bag/case and place a green 'QA Pass' sticker on it, with the employee's initials and today's date. Place the component into the 'RESTOCK' bin. \\n\n4. If a component **FAILS** QA inspection, indicate failure in the system (set its status to 'QA Failed'). Remove the yellow 'QA Check' sticker and place a red 'QA Fail' sticker on the component, with the employee's initials and today's date. Place the component into the 'QA FAIL' bin. \\n\n5. Close the order ticket in the system with appropriate notes on failure/pass. If any items failed, send the order to the Vendor Liason. \n\n**Step 4: Damaged Items:**\nTo handle damaged items: \\n\n1. Print out a list of damaged items from the order. \\n\n2. Send damaged order notes to the Vendor Liason. \\n\n3. Put Damaged items into 'DAMAGED' bins, keeping orders together as much as possible. \\n\n4. Make sure the order item stickers and 'Damaged' stickers are still attached to the components. \\n\n4. If any items are deemed dangerous (leaking fluid, sparking, hot to the touch, frayed, stripped wires), place them into the 'UNSAFE DAMAGED' **red** bin. \\n\n5. Call the Warehouse manager immediately for safe disposal.",
