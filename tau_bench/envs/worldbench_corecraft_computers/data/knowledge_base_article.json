Test components individually if possible\n\n### Safety Precautions\n- **Ground yourself** regularly by touching the case\n- **Work on hard surfaces** (avoid carpet)\n- **Keep liquids away** from work area\n- **Handle components by edges** only\n- **Never force connections** - they should fit easily\n\n## Step-by-Step Build Process\n\n### Step 1: Case Preparation\n\n#### Case Setup\n1. **Remove both side panels**\n2. **Install I/O shield** (motherboard's rear port cover)\n   - Press firmly into case opening\n   - Ensure all tabs are inside the case\n   - Metal tabs should not block ports\n\n3. **Install motherboard standoffs**\n   - Only use standoffs that align with motherboard holes\n   - Extra standoffs can cause shorts\n   - Hand-tighten only (avoid over-tightening)\n\n4. **Prepare power supply mounting area**\n   - Determine PSU orientation (fan up or down)\n   - Fan down if case has bottom ventilation\n   - Fan up if case sits on carpet or no bottom vents\n\n### Step 2: Motherboard Preparation (Outside Case)\n\n#### CPU Installation\n\n**Intel (LGA Socket)**:\n1. Open CPU socket by lifting retention arm\n2. Remove plastic socket cover (save it)\n3. Align CPU triangle with socket triangle\n4. Drop CPU in gently (should sit flush)\n5. Lower retention arm (requires moderate force)\n\n**AMD (PGA Socket)**:\n1. Lift CPU retention arm\n2. Align CPU triangle with socket triangle\n3. CPU should drop in with zero force\n4. Lower retention arm gently\n\n#### Memory (RAM) Installation\n1. **Open memory slot clips**\n2. **Check motherboard manual** for proper slot configuration\n   - 2 sticks: Usually slots A2 and B2 (2nd and 4th from CPU)\n   - 4 sticks: All slots (A1, A2, B1, B2)\n3. **Align RAM notch** with slot notch\n4. **Press down firmly** until clips snap into place\n5. **Verify even seating** - both ends should be level\n\n#### M.2 NVMe Drive Installation\n1. **Locate M.2 slots** on motherboard\n2. **Remove mounting screw** (usually pre-installed)\n3. **Insert drive at 30-degree angle**\n4. **Press down and secure** with screw\n5. **Use thermal pads** if provided with motherboard\n\n### Step 3: CPU Cooler Installation\n\n#### Thermal Paste Application\n\n**For 2-Screw Cooler Brackets (AIO/Large Air Coolers)**:\n- **Method**: Spreading technique\n- **Amount**: Rice grain sized amount\n- **Application**:\n  1. Place small amount in center of CPU\n  2. Use plastic card or included spreader\n  3. Spread evenly in thin layer across entire CPU surface\n  4. Avoid air bubbles\n  5. Layer should be translucent\n\n**For 4-Screw Cooler Brackets (Standard Air Coolers)**:\n- **Method**: Dot technique\n- **Amount**: Pea-sized dot\n- **Application**:\n  1. Place single dot in center of CPU\n  2. Do NOT spread manually\n  3. Let cooler mounting pressure spread paste\n  4. This method reduces air bubble formation\n\n#### Air Cooler Installation\n1. **Install mounting brackets** per manual instructions\n2. **Apply thermal paste** using appropriate method above\n3. **Mount cooler** with even pressure on all mounting points\n4. **Tighten screws** in X-pattern (diagonal opposite corners)\n5. **Connect cooler fan** to CPU_FAN header\n\n#### AIO Liquid Cooler Installation\n1. **Apply thermal paste** using spreading method\n2. **Mount pump/block** to CPU with even pressure\n3. **Install radiator** in case (front or top recommended)\n4. **Connect pump** to CPU_FAN or AIO_PUMP header\n5. **Connect radiator fans** to CHA_FAN headers\n\n### Step 4: Motherboard Installation in Case\n\n1. **Carefully place motherboard** on standoffs\n2. **Align with I/O shield ports**\n3. **Install screws** in all standoff positions\n4. **Don't over-tighten** - snug is sufficient\n\n### Step 5: Power Supply Installation\n\n1. **Orient PSU correctly** (fan direction)\n2. **Slide into position** from inside case\n3. **Secure with 4 screws** from outside rear of case\n4. **Leave PSU power switch OFF** until build complete\n\n### Step 6: Storage Drive Installation\n\n#### SATA Drives (2.5\" SSD / 3.5\" HDD)\n1. **Mount drives** in appropriate bays\n2. **Secure with screws** (usually 4 per drive)\n3. **Connect SATA power** from PSU\n4. **Connect SATA data** to motherboard\n\n#### Additional M.2 Drives\n1. **Install in remaining M.2 slots**\n2. **Check motherboard manual** for SATA/PCIe lane conflicts\n3. **Use heatsinks** if motherboard doesn't provide them\n\n### Step 7: Graphics Card Installation\n\n1. **Remove PCIe slot covers** from case (usually 2 slots)\n2. **Open PCIe x16 retention clip**\n3. **Align card with top PCIe x16 slot**\n4. **Press down firmly** until clip engages\n5. **Secure with screws** to case bracket\n6. **Connect PCIe power cables** (if required)\n\n### Step 8: Power Connections\n\n#### Essential Power Connections\n1. **24-pin ATX** to motherboard\n2. **8-pin CPU power** (top-left of motherboard)\n3. **PCIe power** to graphics card (if required)\n4. **SATA power** to drives\n5. **Molex/peripheral** connections as needed\n\n#### Modular PSU Cable Management\n- **Use only required cables**\n- **Route behind motherboard tray**\n- **Leave some slack** for component access\n- **Secure with zip ties**\n\n### Step 9: Front Panel Connections\n\n#### Required Connections\n- **Power button** (PWR SW)\n- **Reset button** (RST SW) \n- **Power LED** (PWR LED)\n- **HDD LED** (HDD LED)\n- **USB headers** (USB 2.0 and 3.0/3.1)\n- **Audio headers** (HD AUDIO)\n\n**Tip**: Consult motherboard manual for exact pin layout\n\n## Airflow Configuration\n\n### Understanding Air Movement\n\n#### Push vs Pull Fan Configurations\n\n**Push Configuration**:\n- **Fan blows air THROUGH** radiator/heatsink\n- **More effective** for dust filtration\n- **Better for high-restriction** components\n- **Easier maintenance** (clean fan side)\n\n**Pull Configuration**:\n- **Fan draws air THROUGH** radiator/heatsink\n- **Slightly better cooling** in some scenarios\n- **More difficult** to clean (dust on heatsink side)\n- **Can create negative pressure**\n\n### Case Fan Placement & Direction\n\n#### Front Case Fans (Intake)\n**Configuration**: 2-3 fans, 120mm or 140mm\n- **Direction**: Push (blowing INTO case)\n- **Purpose**: Bring cool air into case\n- **Mounting**: Fans on outside of case, pushing through dust filter\n- **Benefits**: Creates positive pressure, reduces dust\n\n#### Rear Case Fan (Exhaust)\n**Configuration**: 1 fan, typically 120mm\n- **Direction**: Pull (drawing air OUT of case)\n- **Purpose**: Exhaust hot air from CPU area\n- **Mounting**: Fan inside case, pulling air through rear vent\n- **Location**: Behind CPU cooler area\n\n#### Top Case Fans (Exhaust)\n**Configuration**: 1-2 fans, 120mm or 140mm\n- **Direction**: Pull (drawing air OUT of case)\n- **Purpose**: Exhaust hot air rising from components\n- **Mounting**: Fans inside case, pulling air up and out\n- **Considerations**: \n  - May interfere with tall CPU coolers\n  - Creates negative pressure if too many exhaust fans\n\n### Optimal Airflow Patterns\n\n### Case Pressure Systems\n\n#### Understanding Case Pressure\nCase pressure affects cooling efficiency, dust accumulation, and system noise. The relationship between intake and exhaust fans determines whether your case operates under positive, negative, or neutral pressure.\n\n#### Positive Pressure Setup\n**Configuration**: More intake CFM than exhaust CFM\n- **Setup Examples**:\n  - 3 intake front (120mm @ 1200 RPM) + 1 exhaust rear (120mm @ 1000 RPM)\n  - 2 intake front (140mm @ 1000 RPM) + 1 exhaust rear (120mm @ 1000 RPM)\n- **Benefits**:\n  - **Reduced dust infiltration** - air enters through filtered intakes only\n  - **Consistent airflow** - predictable air entry points\n  - **Less maintenance** - dust stays on filters instead of components\n- **Drawbacks**:\n  - **Slightly higher temperatures** - some hot air recirculation\n  - **More noise** - intake fans work harder\n- **Best for**: Dusty environments, low-maintenance systems\n\n#### Negative Pressure Setup\n**Configuration**: More exhaust CFM than intake CFM\n- **Setup Examples**:\n  - 2 intake front (120mm @ 1000 RPM) + 1 exhaust rear + 2 exhaust top (120mm @ 1200 RPM each)\n  - 2 intake front (120mm @ 1000 RPM) + 1 exhaust rear + 1 exhaust top (140mm @ 1200 RPM)\n- **Benefits**:\n  - **Better cooling performance** - efficient hot air removal\n  - **Lower component temperatures** - no hot air recirculation\n  - **GPU cooling boost** - helps exhaust GPU heat faster\n- **Drawbacks**:\n  - **Increased dust infiltration** - air pulled through unfiltered gaps\n  - **More cleaning required** - dust settles on components\n  - **Unpredictable airflow** - air enters from multiple uncontrolled points\n- **Best for**: High-performance systems, clean environments, maximum cooling priority\n\n#### Neutral Pressure Setup\n**Configuration**: Equal intake and exhaust CFM\n- **Setup Examples**:\n  - 2 intake front (120mm @ 1200 RPM) + 1 exhaust rear + 1 exhaust top (120mm @ 1200 RPM each)\n  - 3 intake front (120mm @ 1000 RPM) + 2 exhaust rear + top (140mm @ 1000 RPM)\n- **Benefits**:\n  - **Balanced cooling and dust control**\n  - **Moderate maintenance requirements**\n  - **Good all-around performance**\n- **Drawbacks**:\n  - **Harder to achieve** - requires careful fan selection and speed matching\n  - **Can shift between positive/negative** with fan speed changes\n- **Best for**: Most gaming builds, balanced approach\n\n### Optimal Airflow Patterns by Use Case\n\n#### Standard Gaming Build\n**Setup**: 2 intake front (140mm) + 1 exhaust rear (120mm)\n- **Pressure**: Positive\n- **Benefits**: Good temperatures, reduced dust, quiet operation\n- **Fan Speeds**: Intake 800-1000 RPM, Exhaust 1000-1200 RPM\n\n#### High-Performance Gaming\n**Setup**: 3 intake front (120mm) + 1 exhaust rear + 1 exhaust top (120mm)\n- **Pressure**: Slightly negative\n- **Benefits**: Maximum cooling potential for CPU and GPU\n- **Fan Speeds**: Intake 1000-1200 RPM, Exhaust 1200-1400 RPM\n\n#### Quiet Office Build\n**Setup**: 2 intake front (140mm) + 1 exhaust rear (120mm)\n- **Pressure**: Positive\n- **Benefits**: Very quiet operation, adequate cooling\n- **Fan Speeds**: All fans 600-800 RPM max\n\n#### Overclocking/Enthusiast\n**Setup**: 3 intake front + 1 intake bottom + 1 exhaust rear + 2 exhaust top\n- **Pressure**: Balanced to slightly negative\n- **Benefits**: Maximum heat removal for extreme cooling\n- **Fan Speeds**: Intake 1000-1400 RPM, Exhaust 1200-1600 RPM\n\n### Fan Speed Control\n\n#### BIOS Fan Curves\n1. **CPU fans**: Aggressive curve (high speeds at high temps)\n2. **Case fans**: Gentle curve (consistent low-medium speeds)\n3. **GPU fans**: Usually controlled by graphics card\n\n#### PWM vs DC Fans\n- **PWM (4-pin)**: Better speed control, quieter at low speeds\n- **DC (3-pin)**: Voltage controlled, simpler but less precise\n\n### Airflow Troubleshooting\n\n#### Hot Spots\n- **CPU area**: Add rear exhaust if missing\n- **GPU area**: Consider bottom intake or side exhaust\n- **VRM area**: Top exhaust helps remove heat from motherboard\n\n#### Dust Management\n- **Positive pressure** reduces dust infiltration\n- **Clean intake filters** monthly\n- **Mount intake fans** on outside of case when possible\n\n## Cable Management\n\n### Planning Cable Routes\n1. **24-pin ATX**: Route behind motherboard tray\n2. **CPU power**: Route behind and up through top opening\n3. **PCIe power**: Route behind and through side opening\n4. **SATA cables**: Keep short and route behind tray\n5. **Front panel**: Bundle and route to avoid fan interference\n\n### Cable Management Tips\n- **Leave some slack** for future maintenance\n- **Use zip ties** every 4-6 inches\n- **Avoid tight bends** in cables\n- **Keep airflow paths clear**\n- **Route similar cables together**\n\n## Final Assembly Steps\n\n### Pre-Boot Checklist\n1. **Verify all power connections**\n2. **Check RAM is fully seated**\n3. **Confirm CPU cooler is connected**\n4. **Ensure GPU is properly secured**\n5. **Connect monitor to GPU** (not motherboard)\n6. **Switch PSU power ON**\n\n### First Boot\n1. **Press power button**\n2. **Look for POST screen** or motherboard logo\n3. **Enter BIOS** (usually DEL or F2 key)\n4. **Verify all components detected**\n5. **Check temperatures** (should be reasonable at idle)\n6. **Enable XMP/DOCP** for RAM\n7. **Set fan curves** if needed\n\n### Post-Build Testing\n1. **Install operating system**\n2. **Update all drivers**\n3. **Run stress tests**:\n   -
