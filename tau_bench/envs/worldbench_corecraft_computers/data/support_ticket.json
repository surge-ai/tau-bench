My main priorities are maximizing RAM and storage capacity since I work with very large files and need to have multiple projects open simultaneously.\n\nI'm not super familiar with what components work together, so I'd really appreciate some guidance on:\n- What parts I need and which ones are compatible with each other\n- How much RAM I can realistically get in a system\n- Best storage options for my workflow\n- Any other recommendations for animation work\n\nI want something that will last me several years and handle demanding workloads. Budget is flexible if it means better performance.\n\nThanks for any help you can provide!\n\nKylie",
