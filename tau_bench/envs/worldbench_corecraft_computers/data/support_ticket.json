I create content focused on PC building, components, and tech reviews.I'm reaching out to explore a potential partnership opportunity. I'd be interested in reviewing one of your products (sent to me at no cost) in exchange for exposure to my audience. I believe this could be mutually beneficial as my followers are actively interested in PC components and building. Additionally, I'm planning a video about common mistakes people make when ordering PC components, and I'd love to include expert insights from CoreCraft. Could you provide me with a list of the top 5 most common mistakes customers make when ordering different components? This would add credibility to my content and provide value to both our audiences. I'm happy to discuss this further and share my channel statistics and audience demographics if you're interested Looking forward to hearing from you!Best regards, Preston Woodard",

I also need more storage space, which is why I added the SSD.\n\nCan you please make sure that everything is compatible and send the PC fully assembled, including these extra components? How would this affect the expected delivery date?\n\nAlso, I'm wondering how much the Dragonfire PC is discounted compared to ordering the individual parts. Would it be possible to apply this discount to the additional components as well? Can you let me know what the order total would be in this case, including shipping? I'll transfer the money as soon as I get a reply with the final order total.\n\nOne more thing - can I still return the RAM I got in my last order and get a refund for it? I won't be using my old PC anymore.\n\nThanks,\nGregory",

    "body": "Hi. I ordered Celestis SATA 1TB storage on November 20, and the order shows that it was delivered to my mailbox on November 28th. I was at home for Thanksgiving break, and when I got back today I looked for it, but I can't find it anywhere. I've checked with my roommates and everyone in my building, but no one has seen it. What should I do? Can you send another one?",

    "subject": "Gaming PC recommendation for Christmas gift - $2000 budget",
    "body": "Dear CoreCraft,\n\nI'm hoping you can help me put together a gaming PC for my son for Christmas. I have a maximum budget of $2000 and would like to get the highest performance possible within that range, but I'm honestly not sure where to begin.\n\nHe's a really keen gamer and mentioned that his current setup doesn't have enough RAM for the most intensive games. I've been looking at your website and wondered whether the Voltstorm gaming base with 16GB of RAM, although seemingly suitable for a gamer, might not be quite enough for his needs? Can this base be upgraded to 32GB, or would I be better off starting with something like the Dragonfire?\n\nI apologise if I don't sound too knowledgeable about the technical details - this is all quite new to me!\n\nI was also wondering whether, since I've made two orders with you in November (both for him, of course!) whether I'd get any loyalty discounts on my next order.\n\nThank you for any guidance you can provide.\n\nKind regards,\nGisela Mensch",
